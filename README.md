<HORISEON-MARKETING>

## Description
     This is a landing page detailing the features offered by Horiseon Social Solution Services.
     
     My motivation behind refactoring this site was to improve the accessibility standards in order to be inclusive and to allow the site to become better optimized for search engines.

     I wanted to build a site that had descriptive images and a clean style sheet.
     By updating the <div> tags, the site becomes easier to read and find online.

     During this process, I learned how to consolidate different HTML elements with the same styling properties into cleaner code in CSS. I also learned how to use "command + D" to select repeating words.
